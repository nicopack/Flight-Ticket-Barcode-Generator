# Flight-Ticket-Barcode-Generator
This Python script generates a flight ticket barcode in PDF417 format based on user input. It prompts for details like name, booking reference, class, flight details, and more. The QR code is saved in the same directory. This is for educational purposes only; I do not condone any illegal activity.

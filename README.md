# Flight Ticket PDF 417 Generator

This script is intended for educational purposes only. It generates a PDF 417 with flight details that resemble a flight ticket. The generated PDF 417 can be scanned to retrieve the flight information. Please ensure that you do not use this tool for any illegal activities or malicious purposes.

## How it Works
1. The script asks for various inputs, such as:
  - First and last name
  - Booking reference
  - Departure and arrival airports (short form, e.g., "LHR" for London Heathrow)
  - Flight operator and number
  - Day of the year for the departure date
  - Class (Economy, Business, or First)
  - Seat

2. After receiving the inputs, it formats the flight details into a string, and the PDF 417 containing this data is generated, not saved (look under).

## Important Notes
- The PDF 417 will be generated without saving, that's why **YOU** will have to save it or screenshot it to not lose it.
- Make sure to input everything in CAPITAL LETTERS, except the class. Use no spaces and write the airport codes in short form (e.g., "LHR" for London Heathrow).
